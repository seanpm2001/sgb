# Stan Governing Body (SGB)

The Stan Governing Body provides project governance structure
in accord with the NumFOCUS requirements and is the liaison between
the project and NumFOCUS for all fiscally sponsored initiatives.

The SGB is intended to be a transparent body in service of the Stan community.
In that spirit, this repository is used to track SGB initiatives.
